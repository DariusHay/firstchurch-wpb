              First Church of God in Christ History 
The vision to establish a Church of God in Christ in West Palm Beach, Florida, was born in 1924 when a dedicated group of Christians began gathering for prayer at the home of Sister Ella Nottage Perry on the corner of 4th Street and Sapodilla Avenue. As attendance grew and new converts joined, a larger meeting space became necessary. The group then rented a building from Mrs. Collins on Division Avenue, between 6th and 7th Streets, where they continued their prayer services and outreach efforts. 
<br /><br />
Recognizing the need for formal leadership, the founding members — Sister Ella Nottage Perry, Sister Sara Williams, Sister Annie Blaine, Sister Lelia Mae Billingslea, Elder George Billingslea, and Sister Marie Hunt Murray — invited Bishop A.M. Cohen from Miami, Florida, to officially organize the First Church of God in Christ. Bishop Cohen also served as the church’s first pastor for a year, laying a strong spiritual foundation. 
The church experienced significant growth, driven by a passionate commitment to its mission of “BRING THEM IN” — bringing the wandering souls to Jesus Christ. 

<br /><br />The first revival, led by Elder S.P. Croon of Detroit, Michigan, brought a harvest of new believers, solidifying the church’s presence in the community. 
Under the leadership of Elder S.H. Netters from New Orleans, 
Louisiana, the congregation constructed its first dedicated church building on a lot purchased from Mrs. Lizzie Thomas at 12th Street (now Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard) and Sapodilla Avenue. However, the structure was destroyed by the devastating 1928 hurricane, leading members to hold services under a tent. Despite these setbacks, the church persevered, with Deacon Jesse Sims and Brother Dan Rogers selecting the current site at 610 14th Street, West Palm Beach, Florida, for a new building. 
The second church, a wooden structure, served the congregation for many years and is now used for Sunday School classes, a kitchen, and a dining room. The third and current church, a stone building constructed under the pastorate of Elder Murray Junes in the 1940s, stands as a testament to the congregation’s resilience and faith. 

<br /><br />Over the decades, the church has been blessed with dedicated pastors who shepherded the congregation with wisdom and compassion. These include Bishop A.M. Cohen, Elder S.H. Netters*, Elder Thomas B. Smith*, Bishop W.R. Nesbitt*, Elder Alexander Wells*, Elder Murray Junes, Elder Louis 
Praylor*, Bishop E.D. Johnson*, Elder Joseph Williams*, Elder Simeon 
Jimerson*, Elder Kenneth Washington*, Elder Tracy Hughes*, and 
Superintendent Anton V. Manley. (*deceased) 
Many faithful members contributed their time, talent, and resources to sustain the church, including Elder T.H. Shipman, Deacon Dan Rodgers, Brother S.P. Perry, Sister Lula B. Corbett, Mother Rosetta Youman, Mother 
Janie Greene, Mother Minnie Beckett, Sister Bertha Bridges, Sister Cynthia Jimerson, and Sister Annie Mae Greene. Though they have passed on, their legacy of dedication continues to inspire. 
<br /><br />Today, the First Church of God in Christ of West Palm Beach, under the leadership of Elder Deandre Poole, Ph.D., remains committed to its mission of evangelism, discipleship, and community impact. As the church moves forward, it honors its rich history while embracing a renewed vision for the future.
